# Decentralized Partially Autonomous Organization (DPaO)

## Preface

This is not a silver bullet for total automation. This starts as a payment system that is more efficient than that of Visa or MasterCard. Then, it becomes a way to perform trustless payroll. Next, it solves problems related to the transparency of charity organisations by allowing donors to supervise the utilization of funds. 

## Long Vision 

The company would have PABs for various tasks including but not limited to email, tax compliance, etc. However, the behavior of the organization would strictly be according to the law. The business itself could also be sold to other users, thus creating a huge business opportunity for configuring and selling businesses. 

The jobs remaining would be mainly those of professional or creative nature. A lawyer would be needed to interpret the law. A doctor might be needed if the subject is a medical endeavor. An engineer might be needed to produce designs. Creative jobs would include marketing, market research, and others. An accountant might be required to monitor the work of the financial instrument. However, this ought to be outsourced to a firm that specializes in maintaining these systems. Physical labor would also be necessetated.
