## Plan

### Proposal

I have a proposal, but it needs to be in the form of a

 1. presentation, 
 2. document formatted according to the industry standard, 
 3. feasibility study, and
 4. roll-out strategy?
 
Explain why Cardano was the best choice, and compare to alternatives in a matrix.

The coin itself and associated projects. Let us focus on a
ride-sharing DAO, a financial instrument, and two community-service
ideas: banking for the homeless and brining down business expenses.

#### Execution Plan

Therein, we will describe 

 1. the integration with existing services, 
 2. how we will produce educational material to teach our customers
    how the system works starting with the basics, that every
    transaction is final, and how to avoid scams. These should be
    solid with low effort. High return will be training for business
    partners with cost-savings, and
 3. partner with the City of Gainesville. Once our project works, we
    ought to share it with other unions.
	
	
Alternatively, I am going to apply for Fund6.
