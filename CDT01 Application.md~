### Log

20210808134828NJ I am figuring out the databasing of the things.

20210808172721NJ I studied how to use PostgreSQL by referencing the postgresql-13-US.pdf file. I set up a scheme according to [this Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Does-banks-store-money-in-SQL?share=1). 

20210808172921NJ I just found a post that recommends an IBM mainframe with the DB2 database system and cites that this is what most banks around the world use.

20210808175830NJ DB2 uses SQL language, so it should be fine.
